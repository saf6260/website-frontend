## Running the application locally

1. ReactJs. Can be dowloaded using npm via ```npm i react```

#### Working with the app on your system
1. Fork the repositiory and clone the new fork to your local machine
2. Go into the directory you cloned the repository to (if not already there) via ```cd path/to/repository```
3. ```npm install``` 
4. ```npm start```
5. The system should automatically render the react application and take you (by default) to port 3000 to view the application
